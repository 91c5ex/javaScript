    <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Java Script can be divided into two Categories
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Primitive Types.
                    <p>
                        Javascript Primitive Include Number , String of text , boolean Value. <em>null</em> and <em>undifined</em> are primitive value too. <em>null</em> and <em>undifined</em> are the only values that the method cannot be invoked on.
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Object Types.
                    <p>
                        Is a member of type object is a collection's of ,<em>properties</em>. It is a collection of Properties (Having name and value)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Array is an another kind of Object. It is a ordered collection of numbered value
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>function</blockquote> , Yup function is a special kind of Object in java. A function is an Object that has executable code associated with it. Function that are written to be used (with new operator) to iniialize a newly created Object are know as <em>constructor</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>In Addition of Array and Function class core java script define three more class.
                        <br/>The Date class define object that represent date.
                        <br/> The RegExp class define Object that represent regular expression.
                        <br/>Error class that represent syntax and runtime error that can occur in JavaScript Program
                    </p>

                </li>
            </ul>


        </li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <h3> Scope</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript variable are <em>untyped:</em> you can assign value of any type to a variable and you can later assign a value of different type to same variable .Varible are delcared with var keyword. JavaScript uses lexical scoping . Variable declared outside the function are global variable and are visible everywhere in the JavaScript Program. Variable delcared inside the function have function scope and are visible only inside the function.
