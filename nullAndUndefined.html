                <strong>null</strong>  is a language keyword that evalute to a special value that is usually  used to  indicate the absence  of a value. Using  the typeof operator  on null return the string  "object"  indicating that null can be thought of as a speical Object value that indicates "no Object". In pratice however null is regarded as the sole member of its  own type, and it can be used to indicate "no value"  for number and  string as well  as string Object.

                <strong>undefined</strong> value  represent the deeper kind of absence . It is  the value of variable that has not been initalized  and the value you get  when you query  the value of an object  property or array  element that does not exist. The undefined  value   is also returned by function  that have no return value. and the value of function parameter for which  no agrument  is supplied undefined  is a predefined   global variable (not a language keyword like null) that is initalized to the undefined value.undedined is read only variable in ECMAScript 5 ownward. If you  apply  the typeOf operator  to the undefined  value, it return "undefnied" , indicating that the this value is the sole member of the  special type.
