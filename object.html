            <h3>Object</h3>
                
            <p>
                    JavaScript fundamental datatype is object.An Object is unordered collection  of properties each of which has a name and a value.In addition to maintaining its own set of properties . JavaScript also inherit properties of another object , know as "prototype.". The methods of an object  are typically  inherited properties, and the "prototype inheritance" is a key feature of JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p> JavaScript object are dynamic -- properties can usually be added or deleted -- but they can be used to stimulate  the static objects and "structs". Every thing in java is Object. Even the number, string , boolean also behave like immutable objects</p>
                <p>
                    A <em>peoperty</em> has a name  and a value. A property name  be any string , including the empty string,  but no object may have  two properties with the same name. In addition to its name and value, each property has associated  values the we'll  call <em>property attribute</em>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The <em>writable</em> attribute  specifies whether the value of the peoperty can be set</li>
                        <li>
                            The <em>enumerable</em> attribute specifies whether  the property  name is returned  by  a for/in loop.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the <em>configurable</em>  attribute  specifies  whether the property can be deleted  and whether  its attribute  can be altered.
                        </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
        
        <p>
            In addition to its property, every object has three associated  <em>Object Attributes</em>
            <ol>
            <li>
                    An Object's prototype is a reference to another Object from which  properties  are inherited.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An Object's class  is a string  that categorizes the type of an object.
                </li>
                <li>An Object's <em>extensible</em> flag  specifies(ECMA5scipt) may be the new properties may be added  to the Object</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
                  
    <p>Three broad categories of javascript object
        <ul>
        <li>A <em>native Object</em> is an object or class of objects defined by the ECMAScript specification. Arrays. functions, dates, and regular expressions (for exmaple) are native Object</li>
            <li>
                A <em>host Object</em> is an Object defined be the host enviroment (such as browser) within which the JavaScript interpreter is embedded. The HTMLElement object the  represent the structure of a webpage in client-side JavaScript are host Objects. Host Objext may also be native Object , as whenm the host enviroment defines method that are normal JavaScript Function Object.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <em>user-defined</em> is any object create by the execution of JavaScriipt code.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <em>own property</em> is a property defined directly on an object.
            </li>
    </ul>
